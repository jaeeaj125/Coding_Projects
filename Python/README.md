### 20210619_Linear_Regression_Practice:
Topic from *The Data Science Course 2021: Complete Data Science Bootcamp*. We use `sklearn` to build linear regression model with given data set from the csv file, training and testing the model with given inputs and targets. In addition, we use other methods to improve our model.  
* `numpy`, `seaborn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib.pyplot`
* `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`, `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler`, `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`
* `statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence.variance_inflation_factor`
